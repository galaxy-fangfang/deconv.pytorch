# A *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of deconv faster R-CNN

## Introduction
i added the deconv module in the *faster* pytorch implementation of [faster R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), aimed to accelerating the training of faster R-CNN object detection models. Recently, there are a number of good implementations.
